- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in energy and sustainability topics. As a M.Sc Engineering student I've an analytical and critic approach, but sometimes I like dreaming in big too. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use bottom-up energy systems optimization models (especially TIMES and TEMOA). Any suggestion or correction is very welcome.
